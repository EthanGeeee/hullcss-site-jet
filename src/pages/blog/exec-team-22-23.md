## **Welcome to HullCSS**

This post will act as an introduction to the exec team for 2022 - 2023, and also to test out integration with [HullBlogs](https;//hullblogs.com), powered by our friends at [Freeside](https://freeside.co.uk) ðŸ˜„  

With that said lets get to introducing ourselves:

### Toby - President

### Awen - Secretary

### Ben  - Treasurer

### Ethan - Social Media Sec

### Rowan  - Webmaster

I'm Rowan, a 2nd year computer science student and your Webmaster for this year. Whilst I don't hold much power as far as day to day runnings of the society are concerned, I believe my role is an important one nevertheless. It is my job to manage our site (what you are viewing right now), the society's [GitHub](https://github/com/hullcss), advise on contribution and security policies as well as liase with Freeside, as an admin there as well I am able to make sure we can work together effectively. You'll hear me talking a lot about Linux and open-source software. [Learn more here](blog.crimsontome.com).
