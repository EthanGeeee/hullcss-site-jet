## **Welcome to HullCSS**

This post will act as an introduction to the exec team for 2022 - 2023, and also to test out integration with [HullBlogs](https;//hullblogs.com), powered by our friends at [Freeside](https://freeside.co.uk) ðŸ˜„  

With that said lets get to introducing ourselves:

### Toby - President

### Awen - Secretary

Hello hello!! I'm Awen, a second year in Computer Science and your HullCSS secretary for this year. I was previously social secretary, but this year I've exchanged pints for paperwork in the hope of actually finishing my coursework. Personal projects of mine include painting my computer pink and trying to get Doom to run on a Tamagotchi, as well as the endless task of trying to get a functional sleep schedule. My main interests in the field of computer science are accessible technologies and computing education - maybe one day I'll combine the two! Lovely to meet you, and looking forward to a great year for HullCSS!

### Ben  - Treasurer

### Ethan - Social Media Sec

### Rowan  - Webmaster

I'm Rowan, a 2nd year computer science student and your Webmaster for this year. Whilst I don't hold much power as far as day to day runnings of the society are concerned, I believe my role is an important one nevertheless. It is my job to manage our site (what you are viewing right now), the society's [GitHub](https://github.com/hullcss), advise on contribution and security policies as well as liase with Freeside, as an admin there as well I am able to make sure we can work together effectively. You'll hear me talking a lot about Linux and open-source software. [Learn more here](https://blog.crimsontome.com).
